# PyBer_Analysis

## Project Overview
This project we will be creating visualizations of rideshare data for PyBer to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. 

## Results
Urban city type dominates in terms of total fares (63%), total rides (68%) and total drivers (81%). Suburban city type came in second with total fares (31%), total rides (26%) and total drivers (17%). Coming in last is rural city type with total fares (7%), total rides (5%) and total drivers (3%). Surprising even with lower driver counts and total rides in rural city type, the average fare tends to be higher than both suburban and urban city types.

For additional findings please refer to the following figures:
